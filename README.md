# Pizza-Place-Sales-Process

For this Power BI project, I chose to clean and transform the dataset in Power Query. The Pizza_Place_Sales_Process document describes my overall approach. 

I have included views in the 'Custom SQL File' in order to illustrate that this is another way to get the dataset into Power BI. It was good practice, nonetheless.
