# Pizza-Place-Sales-PowerBI

For this Power BI project, I chose to clean and transform the dataset in Power Query. The Pizza_Place_Sales_Process document describes my approach. 

I have included views in the 'SQL Custom File' as another way to get the dataset into Power BI. This is an extension of the repository 'Pizza-Place-Sales-Data-Cleaning-In-SQL'
